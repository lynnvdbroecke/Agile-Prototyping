# Agile Future Design Plan
## 2.1 Identify Future Gaps
**Mid-future (in 5 years):**
To meet the growing focus on environmental sustainability and the increasing demand for large-scale events such as summer festivals to be more sustainable and CO2 neutral, there are several gaps in the building industry that need to be addressed.
1.	Sustainable Event Infrastructure Design: 
There will be a need to develop sustainable event infrastructure designs that minimize resource consumption, waste generation, and carbon emissions. This includes creating temporary structures that are easily assembled and disassembled, use renewable materials, and incorporate energy-efficient technologies.

2.	Recycled Materials and Zero-Waste Construction Practices: 
The demand for recycled and eco-friendly building materials will surge. There will be a need for a wider range of construction materials made from recycled materials and materials with a lower carbon footprint. Developing new, durable, and sustainable materials suitable for large-scale event construction will be essential. There will be a growing emphasis on zero-waste construction practices in the future. Builders must adopt methods that minimize waste generation during the construction and dismantling of event.

3.	Green Energy Integration: 
The integration of renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and energy-efficient lighting, into event infrastructure will be crucial. Building companies will need to develop cost-effective and scalable solutions for incorporating green energy into temporary structures.

4.	Scalable Sustainable Solutions: 
As the capacity of festivals increases, there will be a need for scalable sustainable solutions. Building companies will need to develop modular and adaptable designs that can be easily expanded or reduced to accommodate varying crowd sizes while maintaining sustainability standards.

5.	Waste Management Innovations: 
With a focus on sustainability, there will be a need for innovations in waste management within the construction of large events. Developing efficient waste collection, separation, and recycling systems specific to event infrastructure will be essential.

6.	Environmental Impact Assessment Tools: 
Tools and methodologies for assessing the environmental impact of large events and their associated infrastructure will need to be developed. These tools can help evaluate the carbon footprint, resource usage, and ecological consequences of festivals and guide decision-making.
