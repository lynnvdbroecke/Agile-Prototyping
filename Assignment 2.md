## 2.1 Identify Future Gaps
**Mid-future, 5 years**

To meet the growing focus on environmental sustainability and the increasing demand for large-scale events such as summer festivals to be more sustainable and CO2 neutral, there are several gaps in the building industry that need to be addressed.

1.	Sustainable Event Infrastructure Design: 
There will be a need to develop sustainable event infrastructure designs that minimize resource consumption, waste generation, and carbon emissions. This includes creating temporary structures that are easily assembled and disassembled, use renewable materials, and incorporate energy-efficient technologies.

2.	Recycled Materials and Zero-Waste Construction Practices: 
The demand for recycled and eco-friendly building materials will surge. There will be a need for a wider range of construction materials made from recycled materials and materials with a lower carbon footprint. Developing new, durable, and sustainable materials suitable for large-scale event construction will be essential. There will be a growing emphasis on zero-waste construction practices in the future. Builders must adopt methods that minimize waste generation during the construction and dismantling of event.

3.	Green Energy Integration: 
The integration of renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and energy-efficient lighting, into event infrastructure will be crucial. Building companies will need to develop cost-effective and scalable solutions for incorporating green energy into temporary structures.

4.	Scalable Sustainable Solutions: 
As the capacity of festivals increases, there will be a need for scalable sustainable solutions. Building companies will need to develop modular and adaptable designs that can be easily expanded or reduced to accommodate varying crowd sizes while maintaining sustainability standards.

5.	Waste Management Innovations: 
With a focus on sustainability, there will be a need for innovations in waste management within the construction of large events. Developing efficient waste collection, separation, and recycling systems specific to event infrastructure will be essential.

6.	Environmental Impact Assessment Tools: 
Tools and methodologies for assessing the environmental impact of large events and their associated infrastructure will need to be developed. These tools can help evaluate the carbon footprint, resource usage, and ecological consequences of festivals and guide decision-making.

**Future, 50 years**

In this future, with the continued popularity of outdoor festivals in Denmark, extreme weather conditions due to global warming, and advanced automation, the building industry will face several future gaps.

1.	Large Climate-Resilient Structures: 
There will be a need for the development of climate-resilient megastructures capable of accommodating large festival crowds while providing shelter from extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall and storms. These structures should be modular and adaptable to different event sizes.

2.	Advanced Weather Prediction and Management: 
Building companies and event organizers will require highly advanced weather prediction and management systems that can provide accurate forecasts and real-time updates on changing weather conditions. This includes the ability to make rapid adjustments to infrastructure and schedules to ensure visitor safety and comfort.

3.	Climate-Adaptive Materials: 
The construction industry will need to innovate and produce climate-adaptive materials that can withstand extreme temperature variations, heavy rainfall, and drought conditions while remaining structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing.

4.	Carbon-Neutral and Sustainable Infrastructure: 
Building companies will need to develop innovative solutions for achieving zero or negative carbon emissions during the construction, operation, and dismantling of festival structures.

5.	Advanced Automation and Robotics: 
Automation will play an even larger role in the construction and maintenance of event infrastructure. Robotics and automated systems will need to be developed to handle the assembly, disassembly, cleaning, and maintenance of large-scale event structures efficiently.

6.	Energy Harvesting and Storage: 
The building industry will need to focus on energy harvesting and storage solutions to power large events sustainably. This may involve advanced solar and wind energy systems, as well as energy-efficient storage technologies to ensure a continuous power supply.

7.	Waste-to-Resource Management: 
There will be a need for advanced waste-to-resource management systems that can convert festival waste into valuable resources, such as energy, building materials, or recycling feedstock, thus minimizing environmental impact.

8.	Resilient Transportation Infrastructure: 
With increasing visitor numbers, transportation infrastructure to and from festival sites will need to be resilient to weather-related disruptions while accommodating more and more people without causing huge traffic jams. This includes designing flood-resistant roads and bridges and promoting sustainable transportation options.

9.	Regulatory Frameworks for Extreme Weather Preparedness: 
Governments and event managers will need to establish comprehensive regulatory frameworks focused on extreme weather preparedness for large-scale events. These regulations should cover safety standards, evacuation procedures, and infrastructure resilience requirements.
